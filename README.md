# CPSC 310 Project Repository

This repository contains starter code for the class project.
Please keep your repository private.

Piazza is your best resource for additional details about the [project](https://github.com/ubccpsc/310/blob/2019sept/project/README.md), [AutoTest](https://github.com/ubccpsc/310/blob/2019sept/project/AutoTest.md), and the specific requirements of each [project deliverable](https://github.com/ubccpsc/310/blob/2019sept/README.md#project-sprint-schedule).
These resources will be frequently updated as the term progresses.

## Configuring your environment

To start using this project, you need to get your computer configured so you can build and execute the code.
To do this, follow these steps; the specifics of each step (especially the first two) will vary based on which operating system your computer has:

1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (v2.9+). After installing you should be able to execute `git --version` on the command line.

1. [Install Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v10.14.X), which will also install NPM (you should be able to execute `node --version` and `npm --version` on the command line).

1. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (v1.12+). You should be able to execute `yarn --version` afterwards.

1. Clone your repository by running `git clone REPO_URL` from the command line. You can get the REPO_URL by clicking on the green button on your project repository page on GitHub.

## Project commands

Once your environment is configured you need to further prepare the project's tooling and dependencies.
In the project folder:

1. `yarn install` to download the packages specified in your project's *package.json* to the *node_modules* directory.

1. `yarn build` to compile your project. You must run this command after making changes to your TypeScript files.

1. `yarn test` to run the test suite.

## Running and testing from an IDE

WebStorm should be automatically configured the first time you open the project (WebStorm is a free download through their students program). For other IDEs and editors, you'll want to set up test and debug tasks and specify that the schema of all files in `test/queries` should follow `test/query.schema.json`.

# Purpose 
This project is a TypeScript-based course scheduler built for CPSC 310 at UBC. It allows users to query and manage scheduling data such as courses and room availability. Core features include parsing .zip datasets, filtering based on user-specified criteria, and generating optimal room schedules. It uses a modular design, automated testing with Mocha/Chai, and follows principles of RESTful service design.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Stack

* **TypeScript** ‚Äì for both backend and frontend logic, bringing strong typing to JavaScript 
* **Node.js** ‚Äì provides the server runtime environment .

## üß© Dataset Handling

* **jszip** ‚Äì to handle compressing and decompressing ZIP datasets .
* **fs-extra** ‚Äì for enhanced file system operations like reading, writing, and managing files 

## üîå Web Server & API

* **restify** (or Express.js in some variations) ‚Äì builds the RESTful API layer for dataset management and querying .

## üì¶ Package Manager & Build Tools

* **Yarn** ‚Äì used for dependency management
* **ts-node** & **tsconfig** ‚Äì compile and run TypeScript seamlessly 

## ‚úÖ Testing

* **Mocha** ‚Äì testing framework.
* **Chai** (with chai-as-promised) ‚Äì assertion library for both synchronous and asynchronous code 
* **@ubccpsc310/folder-test** and optionally **nyc** ‚Äì for organizing tests and measuring code coverage 

## üß© Frontend

* **Vanilla JavaScript** ‚Äì often used in initial checkpoints 
* **Next.js** (in some implementations) ‚Äì a React-based framework for more advanced front‚Äëends .

### üîÅ Typical Workflow

1. **Ingest** ZIP files (courses or rooms).
2. **Parse & store** data locally (no external DB).
3. **Process** user queries (filter, sort, group).
4. **Serve** results via a REST API.
5. **Test** all endpoints and data operations using Mocha/Chai.
